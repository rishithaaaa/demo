City of stars
Are you shining just for me?
City of stars
There's so much that I can't see
Who knows?
Is this the start of something wonderful and new?
Or one more dream that I cannot make true?

City of stars
Just one thing everybody wants
There in the bar And through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants
It's love
Yes, all we're looking for is love from someone else
A rush
A glance
A touch
A dance

Look in somebodys eyes 
To light up the sky 
to open the world and 
send me breathing 
the voice that says i will be here 
and you will be alright


I dont care if i know
Just where i will go
'Cause all that i need's this crazy feeling
A rat-tat-tat on my heart...
