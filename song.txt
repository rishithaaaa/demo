City of stars
Are you shining just for me?
City of stars
There's so much that I can't see
Who knows?
Is this the start of something wonderful and new?
Or one more dream that I cannot make true?

I dont care if i know
Just where i will go
'Cause all that i need's this crazy feeling
A rat-tat-tat on my heart...
